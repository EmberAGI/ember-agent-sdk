# Ember Agent SDK

This SDK allows AI agents to make operations in the blockchain. This SDK is built by
using auto-generated code based on an Open API schema, which then gets tested by the
library tests setup in this repository. The `main` branch will always have the latest
regenerated spec and will do so automatically each time the spec is modified. As such,
for now only modify the `tests` folder or the schema as other code will for now only
be autogenerated.
